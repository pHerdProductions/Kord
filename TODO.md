# TO DO

* #### Convert to p5.js for website utilization
  - ###### Or create same idea with HTML/CSS/JS and possibly React (would ease on the need for many if/switch statements for buttons/pages/menus)
* ##### Add menu for selecting MIDI controller
* ##### Add more courses (I.E. chord progressions)
* ##### Seperate classes and functions into their own files
