# Kord
<--An educational music game utilizing a MIDI keyboard to aid the user in learning music chords in different notations-->

Hey guys, welcome to KORD!
This was my project for my final capstone class to get my degree.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Connect your MIDI keyboard and make sure it's turned on, ready to go.
2. Open the application (the program should automatically connect to the MIDI)
3. Go to play, select what lesson, difficulty, and mode you'd like to play.
	(careful, pro is actually pro!)
4. Press the keys corresponding to the chord, simple as that!
	(the program will wait for either 3 keys (triads) or 4 keys (sevenths) to be pressed
	before accepting an answer)
5. If you acheive a new highscore, it will prompt you for your initials.
	- Press any key to scroll through the letter.
	- Press any MPC pad to cycle through each of the 3 intiials

I made this with my AKAI Pro MPK261, so as far as compatability goes, most AKAI keyboards
should work. However, I'm really unsure of other keyboards at this time.

If you have any questions, feel free to hit me up, and if you're having problems getting it to
work, I'm more than happy to edit the program for you and your keyboard.

I would like to keep working on this, updating graphics, add more lessons, create better
cross-platform & cross-keyboard compatability. However that's not possible without you guys!
I appreciate any feedback, support, ideas, etc...

Good luck, have fun, but most importantly, learn more about music!
